You are a bacteria with a special skill -- you can eat plastic! 

Save the oceans by eating all the micro and macroplastics!

Avoid bacteriophages - they want to eat you.

Collect plasmids - they give you special skills (temporary resistance to bacteriophages, ability to draw in plastic from a greater distance, health boost...).
